# Spotlight

Experimental GPTScript tool that uses AppleScript to query Spotlight Search and automatically select the first result.

Unfortunately it seems that there is no actual API for Spotlight.

> Note: your terminal application (or wherever you run gptscript from) will likely ask for accessibility-related
> permissions on your Mac in order to use this tool. This is because we have to use AppleScript to interact with Spotlight.

## Example

```
